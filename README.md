A basic cats vs dogs app I made using Python, CNN, and React+TypeScript +TailwindCSS for the frontend. A fair start to learning how to make full stack ML apps. Also at the time of this, I am currently learning frontend as well, so allows me to practice plenty.


deployed(frontend) @ https://cats-ashen-nu.vercel.app/ <br>
frontend for this can be found at https://github.com/poorvigupta26/cats-frontend/
